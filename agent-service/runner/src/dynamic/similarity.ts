 * from a runner that is otherwise deliberately offline unless a step was
 * granted egress — three new failure modes and a new secret, to answer a
 * question ("is this the same post again?") that lexical overlap answers well.
 * It is also a PURE function, so its behaviour is pinned by unit tests rather
 * than by a provider's model version silently changing under us.
 *
 * The measure is Jaccard overlap over word trigrams: |A ∩ B| / |A ∪ B| where A
 * and B are the sets of 3-word sequences in each text. Trigrams rather than
 * single words because word-level overlap is dominated by function words —
 * two entirely unrelated marketing posts share "of the", "for your", "we are"
 * and score misleadingly high. A trigram survives paraphrase poorly and
 * reordering not at all, which is exactly the signal wanted: "did this agent
 * emit substantially the same sentences again".

 * around 0.2-0.3. 0.40 is comfortably above the "same subject, honestly
