/**
 * The de-duplication measure (docs/dynamic-agent-guardrails.md §3.3).
 *
 * This is the whole reason the scoring is a pure function rather than an
 * embedding call: the threshold is a product decision, and these tests are
 * what pin it. The calibration block below is the load-bearing part — it
 * asserts the BANDS the 0.40 threshold sits between, so a change to the
 * measure that quietly moved "honestly rewritten" above the line, or
 * "re-emitted with edits" below it, turns this file red rather than silently
 * changing what staff get flagged about.
